# 🚗Electric Vehicle Sales Analysis 

## 🔍Problem Statement
AtliQ Motors is an automotive giant from the USA specializing in electric vehicles 
(EV). In the last 5 years, their market share rose to 25% in electric and hybrid 
vehicles segment in North America. As a part of their expansion plans, they wanted 
to launch their bestselling models in India where their market share is less than 2%. 
Bruce Haryali, the chief of AtliQ Motors India wanted to do a detailed market study 
of existing EV/Hybrid market in India before proceeding further.

## 📊Task
I conducted an in-depth analysis of electric vehicle (EV) sales data for AtliQ Motors, focusing on sales by state and manufacturer for 2-wheelers and 4-wheelers. Using key metrics like penetration rate and CAGR, I identified market trends and growth patterns, helping to inform the company's expansion strategy in India.
